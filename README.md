## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Basics of grid and making a mobile menu


### Continued development
My layout is certainly not perfect,i had some trouble on the alignment part on devices with greater resolution than the ones proposed by the challenge (1440px and 375px). In future projects i want to practice more grid and be smarter using it, so that makes the layout far more responsive. One technique i used in this project is making use of template-areas, is pretty simple, but as the project started to get more complex the responsitivity got messy. Probably i'll make more use of 1fr/auto from now on. Also using two headers (one for mobile and the other for desktop) is certaninly not the best practice, in my next projects its an issue that i want to get rid of. Also, starting with the mobile design (mobile-first), is a practice i will make a habit from now on too.

### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/- As always w3schools helped me a lot. When i want to learn a specif topic in css and html i always go there. It helped me in html tags and grid in this project.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9TImlAoMc0 - This is a great video that taught me about both picture tag and source tag, which helped me with the image responsivity.
